# 2-Day Roadmap: Agentic Content Generation System

## Day 1: System Design & Core Implementation

### Morning
- Review assignment requirements and clarify scope
- Design high-level architecture (agents, orchestration, data flow)
- Define internal product data model
- Plan agent boundaries and responsibilities

### Midday
- Implement product data parser agent
- Implement question generation agent (at least 15 categorized questions)
- Design and implement content logic blocks (e.g., benefits, usage, comparison)

### Afternoon
- Implement template engine (FAQ, Product, Comparison pages)
- Integrate logic blocks with templates
- Begin assembling FAQ and Product pages
- Write initial documentation structure (docs/projectdocumentation.md)

## Day 2: Completion, Testing & Documentation

### Morning
- Implement comparison agent (compare AeroClean with fictional Product B)
- Assemble all three pages (FAQ, Product, Comparison)
- Ensure all outputs are valid JSON

### Midday
- Test the full agentic pipeline end-to-end
- Refactor for modularity, clarity, and extensibility
- Add error handling and edge case coverage

### Afternoon
- Finalize documentation (problem statement, solution overview, system design, diagrams)
- Review all requirements and evaluation criteria
- Polish code, comments, and repo structure
- Prepare and verify submission (GitHub repo, docs)

**Goal:** Deliver a modular, agentic, production-style content generation system with clear documentation and clean, machine-readable outputs within 2 days.
