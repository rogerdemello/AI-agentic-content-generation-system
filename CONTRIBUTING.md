# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to this project. A few simple guidelines:

- Create an issue first to discuss significant changes or features.
- Fork the repository and open a pull request from a feature branch.
- Write focused commits and use conventional commit messages (eg. `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`).
- Ensure new code includes tests and that `python test_system.py` passes locally.
- Follow the code style: `black` formatting and `flake8` linting.

If you're unsure about anything, open an issue and we'll discuss the best approach.
